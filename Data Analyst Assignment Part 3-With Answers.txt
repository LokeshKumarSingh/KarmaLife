Write a function that accepts a string and returns a mapping (a dictionary or dictionary-like structure) 
that has words as the keys and the number of times each word was seen as the values.

Your function should work like this:

>>> count_words("oh what a day what a lovely day")
{'oh': 1, 'what': 2, 'a': 2, 'day': 2, 'lovely': 1}
>>> count_words("don't stop believing")
{"don't": 1, 'stop': 1, 'believing': 1}

Try to cover as many corner cases possible :)

ANSWER:

#USE OF Library

from collections import Counter
def count_words(sen):
    new_sen = sen.split(" ")
    print(dict(Counter(new_sen)))
count_words("oh what a day what a lovely day")


#Without_Library

def count_words(sen):
    d = dict()
    sen = sen.strip()
    sen = sen.lower()
    words = sen.split(" ")
    for word in words:
        if word in d:
            d[word] = d[word] + 1
            # print (d[word])
        else:
            d[word] = 1
      
    # Print the contents of dictionary
    for key in list(d.keys()):
        print(key, ":", d[key])
count_words("oh what a day what a lovely day")
